# Introduction
OpenTripPlanner library for iOS, written in Swift.
**OTPKit** is a reusable library that powers trip planning in the [OneBusAway iOS app](https://github.com/OneBusAway/onebusaway-ios) and can be integrated into any iOS application.

- Compatible with **iOS 18+**
- Works with **OpenTripPlanner 1.5.x and higher**
- Licensed under **Apache 2.0**
- Provides networking, models, and APIs for building a complete trip planning experience

## Quick Start

### Installation

Add **OTPKit** to your iOS project using **Swift Package Manager**:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/OneBusAway/OTPKit.git", from: "1.0.0")
]
```
### SwiftUI Usage
```swift
import OTPKit

struct ContentView: View {
   var body: some View {
       // 1. Configure OTPKit with server URL and theme
       let config = OTPConfiguration(
           otpServerURL: URL(string: "https://your-otp-server.com")!,
           region: .userLocation(fallback: .automatic),
           themeConfiguration: OTPThemeConfiguration(primaryColor: .blue, secondaryColor: .gray)
       )

       // 2. Create API service for OpenTripPlanner
       let apiService = RestAPIService(baseURL: config.otpServerURL)

       VStack {
           // 3. Add complete trip planner to your app
           OTPView(otpConfig: config, apiService: apiService)
       }
   }
}
```

### UIKit Usage

```swift
import OTPKit

let config = OTPConfiguration(
    otpServerURL: URL(string: "https://your-otp-server.com")!,
    region: .userLocation(fallback: .automatic)
)

let apiService = RestAPIService(baseURL: config.otpServerURL)
let tripPlannerView = OTPView(otpConfig: config, apiService: apiService)

// Embed in UIKit using UIHostingController
let hostingController = UIHostingController(rootView: tripPlannerView)
addChild(hostingController)
view.addSubview(hostingController.view)

```

## Development

### SwiftLint

OTPKit uses [SwiftLint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint) to enforce consistent code style and Swift best practices.
Install it locally using Homebrew:

```bash
brew install swiftlint
```

### Pre-commit Hooks

The project uses [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) to automatically run SwiftLint and tests before pushing to GitHub.

```bash
# Install pre-commit (first time setup)
brew install pre-commit

# Install the git hook scripts for pre-push
pre-commit install --hook-type pre-push

# (Optional) Run against all files manually
pre-commit run --all-files --hook-stage pre-push
```

Once installed, the following checks will run automatically before each push:
1. **SwiftLint** - Code style and best practices validation
2. **Xcode Tests** - Full test suite must pass

If either linting or tests fail, the push will be blocked until issues are fixed.
