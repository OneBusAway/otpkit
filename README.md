OpenTripPlanner library for iOS, written in Swift.

## Compatibility

* iOS: OTPKit is compatible with iOS 16.0 and higher.
* OTP: OTPKit is known to be compatible with OpenTripPlanner 1.5.x and higher. It is presumed to work on earlier versions, but is not tested on them.

## Architecture

More to come on this in the future, but for now it's worth mentioning that OTPKit uses OTP 1.x's REST API to communicate with OpenTripPlanner servers.
